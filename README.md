INPUT:
There is no direct user input in this app. The content is hard-coded into the app in a way that would display a message with my name, degree program, and university name. The data is written using React Native Text components.

PROCESS:
The app was built using GitHub Codespaces with Expo and React Native. So I used a View to store everything and three Text components to display each line of my message. The layout of the app is styled using StyleSheet as per the assignment requirement. I applied a yellow background color to the View to meet the user requirements and also centered the text in the middle of the screen using basic style properties.

OUTPUT 
When the app runs, it displays a yellow screen with my name, program name, and school name (CityU) displayed across three lines. This serves the purpose of creating a simple mobile app.
